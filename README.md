# Advent Of Code 2025
for this Advent of code I've decided to spice things up a little bit and use a wheel to decide each day what language im going to use: <br>
the link for said wheel is [here](https://wheeldecide.com/?c1=Common%20lisp&c2=Fortran&c3=ASM&c4=Haskell&c5=Ocaml&c6=C%2B%2B&c7=Rust&c8=Cobol&c9=Basic&c10=Pascal&c11=Ada&col=rybg&time=5)

### Day 1
Language Chosen: ```Ada``` <br>
Time Taken: ```~3 Hours``` <br>
